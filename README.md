### Hi, i'm Max ðŸ‘‹
The world of computer technologies is wonderful.<br/>
It is an artificial network of human souls.<br/>
Could anyone in the past imagine such miracle?<br/>
We went much further than our precessters thought of.<br/>

#### Look at your screen
See that<br/>
you screen shapes your thinking.<br/>
But who shapes the screen?<br/>
Are you friends? Do you know her?<br/>
Do you have your favorite button?<br/>

#### Is it our responsibility to develop the world?
WE hold future of humanity<br/>
But we all need fresh air.
Where are breakthrough that
Will improve each of us?
Or we are already good enough?
Where are breakthrough in Science?..
Human-Computer interface?..
First human on Mars?
Do you see beneath your nose?

Wind is changing
It blows the canvas.
