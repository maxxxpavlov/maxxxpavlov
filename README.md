### Hi, i'm Max ðŸ‘‹
The world of computer technologies is wonderful.<br/>
It is an artificial network of human souls.<br/>
Could anyone in the past imagine such miracle?<br/>
We went much further than our ancesters thought of.<br/>

#### Look at your screen
See that<br/>
you screen shapes your thinking.<br/>
But who shapes the screen?<br/>
Do you have your favorite button?<br/>

#### Is it our responsibility to develop the world?
WE are future of humanity<br/>
But we all need fresh air.<br/>
Where are breakthrough that<br/>
Will improve each of us?<br/>
Or we are already good enough?<br/>
Where are breakthrough in Science?..<br/>
Human-Computer interface?..<br/>
First human on Mars?<br/>
Do you see beneath your nose?<br/>

Wind is changing<br/>
It blows the canvas.
Means
Canvas is blown by changing.
